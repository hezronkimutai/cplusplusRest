# Active Context - C++ REST Application

## Current Work Focus
✅ **COMPLETED** - Full C++ REST API application with modern C++ practices and clean architecture.

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Implemented complete REST API with all CRUD endpoints
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Created testing scripts for PowerShell and Bash
- ✅ Downloaded and integrated all dependencies
- ✅ Built complete project structure with build systems
- ✅ Documented everything with comprehensive README

## Next Steps
**Project is complete and ready for use!**
1. Install a C++ compiler (Visual Studio, MinGW, or GCC)
2. Run `build.bat` (Windows) or `make` (Linux/macOS)
3. Execute the server: `build/bin/CppRestAPI.exe`
4. Test with provided scripts or manual API calls

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using header-only libraries to minimize build complexity
- In-memory data storage for simplicity (extensible to database later)
- Thread-safe design for concurrent request handling
- RESTful endpoints following standard HTTP methods and status codes

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Modern C++17 features (auto, smart pointers, range-based loops)
- RAII for resource management
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- JSON-first API design
- Comprehensive error handling

## Learnings and Project Insights
- cpp-httplib provides simple HTTP server capabilities
- nlohmann/json offers excellent C++ JSON integration
- CMake enables cross-platform build management
- Header-only approach reduces deployment complexity
