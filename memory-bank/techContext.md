# Technical Context - C++ REST Application

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: C++17 or later
- **HTTP Library**: cpp-httplib (header-only, lightweight)
- **JSON Library**: nlohmann/json (modern C++ JSON)
- **Build System**: CMake
- **Compiler**: GCC/Clang/MSVC with C++17 support

## Dependencies
- cpp-httplib: For HTTP server functionality
- nlohmann/json: For JSON parsing and serialization
- Standard C++ libraries for threading and utilities

## Development Setup
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Single-threaded or multi-threaded execution
- Header-only dependencies for easy integration
- CMake for build configuration

## Technical Constraints
- Minimal external dependencies
- Header-only libraries preferred
- Modern C++ practices (RAII, smart pointers, etc.)
- Thread-safe design for concurrent requests

## Architecture Decisions
- Single executable application
- Modular code structure with separate headers
- JSON-based API communication
- RESTful endpoint design
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
